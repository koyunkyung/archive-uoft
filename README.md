# Estimating the Number of Doctoral Degree Holders in the US: A Comparative Analysis Using Laplace Ratio Estimators
## Discrepancy Between Estimated and Actual Total Respondents Show Regional Variations in Educational Attainment

## Overview

This reflection provides an analysis using the 2022 ACS data from IPUMS. The focus is on estimating the total number of respondents in each U.S. state (using the STATEICP variable) based on the number of respondents with a doctoral degree (EDUC variable) as their highest educational attainment. The estimation follows the ratio estimators approach of Laplace.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:
-   `other` contains relevant details about LLM chat interactions.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were developed with the assistance of ChatGPT-4.0, particularly for tasks related to data processing, table formatting, and visualization in R. The abstract and introduction were also drafted with support from ChatGPT-4.0, drawing from prior discussions and suggestions. All interactions and detailed usage history are documented in `other/llm_usage/usage.txt`.
