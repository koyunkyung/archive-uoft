## Overview

This repo provides an analysis of price distributions across multiple fruit categories, including apples, mangos, pears, and oranges, to explore vendor-specific pricing trends. It offers resources and templates for SQL-based data extraction and visualization, facilitating the understanding of how prices vary by vendor for each fruit type.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data` contains analysis data that was originally extracted from https://jacobfilipp.com/hammer/, grouped by vendors, and filtered by different types of fruit.
-   `other` contains LLM chat interactions.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the SQL scripts used to clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code for data extraction and SQL analysis were written with the assistance of the large language model, ChatGPT. The process of creating meaningful data visualizations was also aided by ChatGPT. The entire chat history detailing the guidance on SQL queries and visualization generation is available in `other/llm_usage/usage.txt`.
