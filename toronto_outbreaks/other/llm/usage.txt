User
I want to make a simulating data of dates that range from 2020-01 to 2024-06, on a monthly basis.  The simulated data's 'Date' should be in a form of 2020-01, not including the days number. Please generate the codes in R that could generate random numbers that follow the Possion distribution of lambda=10.

ChatGPT
```r
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Define the start and end months
start_date <- as.Date("2020-01-01")
end_date <- as.Date("2024-06-01")

# Generate a sequence of monthly dates between start_date and end_date
monthly_dates <- seq(from = start_date, to = end_date, by = "month")

# Format dates to "YYYY-MM" without including the day
formatted_dates <- format(monthly_dates, "%Y-%m")

# Generate random Poisson distributed numbers with lambda = 10 for each month
lambda <- 10
poisson_values <- rpois(length(formatted_dates), lambda)

# Create a data frame to hold the results
simulated_data <- data.frame(Date = formatted_dates, Poisson_Value = poisson_values)

# View the first few rows of the data
head(simulated_data)

# Save the data to a CSV file if needed
# write.csv(simulated_data, "monthly_simulated_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

With this dataset, I want to create a line plot that shows the trend of outbreak counts, by type of outbreaks. Show the R codes for making that plot. I also want the Respiratory in red, Enteric in Blue, Other in Black.

ChatGPT
```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)

# Convert the year column to a factor with levels in chronological order
annual_data$year <- factor(annual_data$year, levels = unique(annual_data$year))

# Create the line plot
ggplot(annual_data, aes(x = year, y = outbreak_count, group = type_of_outbreak, color = type_of_outbreak)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Respiratory" = "red", "Enteric" = "blue", "Other" = "black")) +
  labs(title = "Trend of Outbreak Counts by Type (2016-2024)",
       x = "Year", y = "Outbreak Count", color = "Type of Outbreak") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE) # Ensure all years are shown on the x-axis
```

I want to create simulation data for the dataset above. Please generate random numbers and also plot what the simulated data looks like. Finally, we have to save the plot image in png files.

ChatGPT
```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Define the years and settings
years <- 2016:2024
settings <- c("Hospital-Acute Care", "Hospital-Chronic Care", "Hospital-Psychiatric", 
              "LTCH", "Retirement Home", "Shelter", "Transitional Care")

# Generate random outbreak counts for each setting and year
data <- expand.grid(Year = years, Setting = settings)
data$Count <- round(runif(nrow(data), min = 0, max = 300))  # Random counts between 0 and 300

# Create the stacked bar chart
ggplot(data, aes(x = Year, y = Count, fill = Setting)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Annual Respiratory Outbreak Counts by Setting",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Outbreak Count",
       fill = "Outbreak Setting") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#d3a9d3", "#a455a4", "#b3b3b3", "#a2d6f9", "#b6f5d3", "#963232", "#000000")) +
  theme_minimal()

# Save the plot as a PNG file
ggsave("outbreaks_reported_by_setting.png", plot = p, width = 10, height = 8, dpi = 300)
```

I want to express exact number of percentages on the pie chart. Provide me with R codes for that.

ChatGPT
```r
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Calculate counts and percentages
outbreak_counts <- data %>%
  count(outbreak_setting) %>%
  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100)

# Create pie chart with percentages
ggplot(outbreak_counts, aes(x = "", y = n, fill = outbreak_setting)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("LTCH" = "#B4E1FF",
                               "Retirement Home" = "#B3FFC6",
                               "Hospital-Chronic Care" = "#BA55D3",
                               "Hospital-Acute Care" = "#DDA0DD",
                               "Hospital-Psychiatric" = "grey",
                               "Shelter" = "brown",
                               "Transitional Care" = "black")) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percentage, 1), "%")),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +  # Add percentage labels
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, fill = "Outbreak Setting",
       title = "Outbreaks Count by Setting") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        panel.grid = element_blank())
```

I want a table that can show all the summary statistics of each variable in this raw dataset.
write the R codes for doing that so that I can put it on my qmd file

ChatGPT
```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Read the dataset
data <- read_csv("path/to/your/raw_data.csv")

# Generate summary statistics for all variables
summary_stats <- data %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), 
                   list(count = ~sum(!is.na(.)),
                        unique = ~n_distinct(.),
                        top = ~names(sort(table(.), decreasing = TRUE)[1]),
                        freq = ~max(table(.), na.rm = TRUE)),
                   .names = "{.col}_{.fn}"))

# Print the summary statistics table
summary_stats
```
