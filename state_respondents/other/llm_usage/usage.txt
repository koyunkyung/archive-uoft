LLM: ChatGPT-4.

User
I want to rename the columns in my table to display custom labels without changing the actual column names.

ChatGPT
You can use the col.names argument in kable() to change the labels displayed in the table without altering the column names in the data. Here's the updated code:
r
Copy code
kable(doctoral_count, col.names = c("State", "Respondents with Doctoral Degree", "Estimated Total Number of Respondents"))


User
I need to format the numbers in the last column of my table to display only two decimal places.

ChatGPT
You can round the numbers using mutate() before passing the data to kable(). Hereâ€™s how you can modify the code:
r
Copy code
doctoral_count <- doctoral_count %>%
  mutate(`Estimated Total Number of Respondents` = round(`Estimated Total Number of Respondents`, 2))
kable(doctoral_count)

User
I'm having trouble with a left_join() because the column STATEICP was renamed to State.

ChatGPT
You can either rename the State column back to STATEICP or rename the column in the other data frame for the join. Here's one solution:

r
Copy code
actual_total_count <- actual_total_count %>%
  rename(State = STATEICP)

doctoral_count <- doctoral_count %>%
  left_join(actual_total_count, by = "State")
  

User
I want to format the x-axis labels in my ggplot2 plot to display numbers with commas (e.g., 1,000 instead of 1e3).

ChatGPT
You can use the scales package to apply this format to the x-axis labels. Here's the code:

r
Copy code
library(scales)

ggplot(data_melted, aes(x = factor(State), y = value, fill = variable)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = scales::comma)  # Format x-axis labels with commas
  
  
User
I want to combine a text and a numeric result in a single sentence.

ChatGPT
You can use paste() or paste0() to concatenate text and numeric values. Here's an example:

r
Copy code
california_ratio <- round(california_doctoral_respondents / california_total_respondents, 3)
result <- paste("The California ratio found was:", california_ratio)
print(result)
